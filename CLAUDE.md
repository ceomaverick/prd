**Always follow these rules:**

1. Dont waste tokens. Be sharp. Be efficient. Be precise.
2. Jump directly to the task. Only scan the full codebase if absolutely necessary.
3. Don’t waste tokens on unnecessary exploration.
4. Don’t assume — ask questions.
5. Keep replies terse but meaningful.
6. Before coding, Say: "This is the implementation plan, Avinash." Show implementation plan as todo list.
